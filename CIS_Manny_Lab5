#Date: 9/30/24
#This program lets a grocery store track the total bottles collected over a week and calculates total payout

#Variables
total_bottles = 0
counter = 1
today_bottles = 0
total_payout = 0
keep_going = 'y'

#This is the loop
while keep_going.lower() == 'y':
    #Reset total bottles and the counter for a new data
    total_bottles = 0
    counter = 1
    
    #Gets the bottles for the 7 days
    while counter <= 7:
        today_bottles = int(input(f"Enter number of bottles returned for day #{counter}: "))
        total_bottles += today_bottles  #Updates the total bottles
        counter += 1  #The counter
    
    #Calculates the total payout for the week
    total_payout = total_bottles * 0.10  #The payout is 10 cents per bottle

    #Prints the results
    print(f"The total number of bottles collected is {total_bottles}")
    print(f"The total paid out is $ {total_payout:.2f}") #Displays the payout

    #Ask if the user wants to run the program again
    print("Do you want to enter another weekâ€™s worth of data? (Enter y or n)")
    keep_going = input().strip()

print("Thank you for using the Bottle Return Program!")
